Python’s CVXOPT package to implement linearly nonseparable (soft margin) SVM in its dual form and test its functionality with the dataset. For 𝐶𝐶 = 0.1 and 𝐶𝐶 = 100, plot the samples, margin hyperplanes, and the decision boundary. Also, on the plot, identify and give the count of the support vectors and the misclassified samples.  

Compare the computational efficiency of the implementation of SVM with one in Python that employs the SMO approach. Present this comparison as a plot of the number of training samples versus execution time.
